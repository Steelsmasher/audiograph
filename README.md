# Audiograph

A standalone music tracking application that runs on Windows.
All data is stored locally on your machine and not sent anywhere else.

## Setup
1. Download the installer at https://audiograph.app/
2. Once installed you will be presented with the connections page. The easiest one to setup is from ListenBrainz

3. If you have a ListenBrainz account you can enter your username. If not you can pick from a user from the publically avaible list here: https://listenbrainz.org/recent.
I use "stebe" for testing.


## Background
I strongly believe that in order to get people caring about their data we need to provide tools that show why data is important to them.
These tools need to be easy to use and make it easy to share data because if something is too difficult no one will use it.
This app was inspired by the annual Spotify Wrapped event. It is one of the rare moments where I witness the average person getting excited about their data.
